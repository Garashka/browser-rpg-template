Aiming to serve as a starting point for creating responsive browser RPG's.

Uses VueJS for front-end and Node + Express for back-end.

Implemented Features:
 * nothing that wouldn't be a massively unscalable security flaw
 
 To be implemented:
  * Account registration system
  * Character creation system
  * Move user accounts to postgres db
  
Uses docker to launch both server and client because I'm a lazy git. From the root directory: docker-compose up

To access from browser clients default to localhost:3000, server to localhost:4000
